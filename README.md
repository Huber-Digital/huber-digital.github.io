# huber-digital.github.io website project

## Purpose

- This project will produce a professionally-looking website for a Digital
  Humanities consultancy called "Huber Digital"
- Huber Digital has a logo of "HD" followed by a pipe symbol followed by a
  mirrored D and a H ( HD|ᗡH ), playing on the pairing of "Huber Digital" and 
  "Digital Humanities"


## Website tech stack

- Bootstrap 5 with light/dark mode
- Vanilla Javascript and/or jQuery
- fixed header and flexible mobile-first layout
- possibly modest use of wow.js or similar for some basic animation
- website to be hosted on Github pages with custom domain name


## Website look and feel

- The website is intended to showcase the consultancy's light-weight design
  approach that avoids technology-heavy solutions and cuts out expensive
  infrastructure and unnecessary technology layers

## HD|DH: principles of our work

- we understand and are used to working with humanities data, which is often
  underspecified or incomplete; 
- we embrace open sustainable community standards, guidelines, and
  documentation; 
- we conduct our projects with citability, longevity, and sustainability in mind 
  from the start: scholarship, whether print or digital, has no end-of-life; 
- we follow the recommendations for open standards, open access, and open
  licensing for research wherever it is appropriate; 
- we offer free advice to projects looking for guidance in particular areas to
  ensure good practice is adopted from the outset (it is in our and everybody’s
  interest to do so); 
- we understand that your research data and research questions are more
  important than technology, we have no intention to bore you with tech-talk; 
- we focus on effective, accessible, no-nonsense Web design;
- we understand that accessibility of delivery platforms and interfaces isn’t
  optional; 
- we provide advice on planning your projects with a view of letting them grow
  and flourish past the initial grant-period or promise of institutional support
  (long-term sustainability planning, independent branding/hosting, outreach
  activities, community-involvement, follow-up events, collaboration proposals,
  follow-on research paths, etc.)

  Humanities methodologies

- Digital Humanities tools (imaging software, editing tools, statistical
  analysis tools, NLP tools, visualizations, LLMs/AI integration, and knowledge
  modelling tools); 
- backend support (servers/VMs/domains/SSL);
- middleware/tools and languages (Python, R, …);

## HD|DH: Who we are?

- We are a team of library professionals with decades of experience working with
  groups and individual researchers and supporting digital projects. We have
  worked with academics in the UK, Europe, and the US. 
- We are passionate about giving greater visibility and support to the enormous
  amount of Digital Humanities work that goes on every day for free on
  researchers’ personal computers. 
- We also believe that Digital Humanities work relies on the digitisation and
  open access availability of historical materials. Students and researchers are
  transcribing and editing these materials all the time — we want to harness
  that work for the common good.
